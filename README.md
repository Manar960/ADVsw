## Overview

EcoTrack is an environmental monitoring and reporting platform that allows users to collect, share, and analyze data related to environmental conditions and climate change. This project focuses on developing a robust backend API to handle data collection, reporting, and user interactions.

## Main Features

- **Data Collection:** Users can submit environmental data from various sources, including IoT sensors, manual observations, or data uploads, covering aspects such as air quality, temperature, humidity, water quality, biodiversity metrics, and more.

- **User Profiles:** Users can create and manage profiles to track their contributions and environmental interests. They can connect with others who share similar concerns or locations.

- **Environmental Alerts:** An alerting system notifies users about significant changes or concerning trends in environmental data. Users can configure alert thresholds based on their interests.

- **Community Reporting:** Users can report environmental issues like pollution, deforestation, or wildlife endangerment.

- **Sustainability Score:** A scoring system assesses users' environmental contributions and sustainability efforts based on the data they provide and the actions they take.

- **Educational Resources:** Offer educational resources, articles, and guides on environmental topics to raise awareness and educate users on sustainable practices.

- **Open Data Access:** Provide APIs for researchers, scientists, and organizations to access aggregated environmental data for research and analysis.
